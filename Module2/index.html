<h1>Our menu</h1>


<div class="desktop tablet"><div class="box"><p id="p1">Chicken</p><p>Feel free to use whatever spices and seasoning you wish, since that will not affect the technique at all. To prep the chicken ahead of time, just cover it in plastic wrap and refrigerate after seasoning.
You're usually told to cook chicken to 165 degrees F (74&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;C), but I usually stop at 150 degrees F (66 degrees C) for more tender results.</p></div></div>
<div class="desktop tablet"><div class="box"><p id="p2">Beef</p><p>Some nights you stare into the open fridge, and it's hard to even think about what to make for dinner. Thankfully, if you have a package of ground beef, things are a whole lot easier. That's because ground beef is incredibly versatile. It can fill out a jar of pasta sauce, thicken a soup, or become a filling beefy mac and cheese. And it's a fantastic base for dozens of easy recipes.</p></div></div>
<div class="desktop tablet"><div class="box"><p id="p3">Sushi</p><p>Don’t get intimidated – rolling sushi is 100x easier than it looks! Your rolls might not come out 5-star restaurant worthy on the first try but it won’t be long before you’re creations are so pretty you’ll want to instagram them!</p></div></div>
